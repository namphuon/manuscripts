abstract = {Infection by human papillomavirus (HPV) is among the main etiologies of cervical cancer. The expression of oncogenic viral proteins enables the onset of the virus, which can trigger the carcinogenic process. One of the main characteristics of this process is the loss of genome stability, including chromosome stability. The micronucleus test is a cytogenetic method for the detection of genetic alterations that change chromosome behavior during cell division resulting in the formation of micronuclei. This method has been applied for the early detection of DNA damage in individuals with a greater likelihood of developing cancer. The aim of the present study was to assess the association between micronucleus expression and the degree of cytological lesions and viral load in patients with HPV. The micronucleus analysis revealed differences in the number micronuclei found in the groups, which ranged from 0.00067 to 0.00133 in the control group and 0.00267 to 0.02433 among patients with HPV. Statistically significant differences (p{\textless}0.05) were found in the number of micronucleated cervical cells between the patients and healthy women. Moreover, significant associations were found between micronucleus expression and both the degree of uterine lesions (r2=0.7237; r=0.8507; p=0.000002) and viral load (r2=0.7012; r=0.8374; p=0.000004). The findings demonstrate the efficacy of micronucleus analysis in monitoring risks to human health. },

Recent mathematical results on the stochastic properties of MSP scores allow an analysis of the performance of this method as well as the statistical significance of alignments it generates. The basic algorithm is simple and robust; it can be implemented in a number of ways and applied in a variety of contexts including straightforward DNA and protein sequence database searches, motif searches, gene identification searches, and in the analysis of multiple regions of similarity in long DNA sequences. In addition to its flexibility and tractability to mathematical analysis, BLAST is an order of magnitude faster than existing sequence comparison tools of comparable sensitivity.},

The error rate of all algorithms is greatly reduced by using statistical scores to evaluate matches rather than percentage identity or raw scores. The E-value statistical scores of SSEARCH and FASTA are reliable: the number of false positives found in our tests agrees well with the scores reported. However, the P-values reported by BLAST and WU-BLAST2 exaggerate significance by orders of magnitude. SSEARCH, FASTA ktup = 1, and WU-BLAST2 perform best, and they are capable of detecting almost all relationships between proteins whose sequence identities are {\textgreater}30{\%}. For more distantly related proteins, they do much less well; only one-half of the relationships between proteins with 20-30{\%} identity are found. Because many homologs have low sequence similarity, most distant relationships cannot be detected by any pairwise comparison method; however, those which are identified may be used with confidence.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Age, reproductive history, hormones, genetics, and lifestyle are known risk factors for breast cancer, but the agents that initiate cellular changes from normal to malignant are not understood. We previously detected bovine leukemia virus (BLV), a common oncogenic virus of cattle, in the breast epithelium of humans. The objective of this study was to determine whether the presence of BLV DNA in human mammary epithelium is associated with breast cancer.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: This was a case-control study of archival formalin fixed paraffin embedded breast tissues from 239 donors, received 2002-2008 from the Cooperative Human Tissue Network. Case definition as breast cancer versus normal (women with no history of breast cancer) was established through medical records and examination of tissues by an anatomical pathologist. Breast exposure to BLV was determined by in situ-PCR detection of a biomarker, BLV DNA, localized within mammary epithelium.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The frequency of BLV DNA in mammary epithelium from women with breast cancer (59{\%}) was significantly higher than in normal controls (29{\%}) (multiply- adjusted odds ratio = 3.07, confidence interval = 1.66-5.69, p = .0004, attributable risk = 37{\%}). In women with premalignant breast changes the frequency of BLV DNA was intermediate (38{\%}) between that of women with breast cancer and normal controls (p for trend {\textless} .001).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Among the specimens in this study, the presence of amplified BLV DNA was significantly associated with breast cancer. The odds ratio magnitude was comparable to those of well-established breast cancer risk factors related to reproductive history, hormones, and lifestyle and was exceeded only by risk factors related to genetics (familial breast cancer), high dose ionizing radiation, and age. These findings have the potential for primary and secondary prevention of breast cancer.},

Here, we describe the first graphic user interface (GUI)-based automated tool 'HPVDetector', for non-computational biologists, exclusively for detection and annotation of the HPV genome based on next-generation sequencing data sets.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We developed a custom-made reference genome that comprises of human chromosomes along with annotated genome of 143 HPV types as pseudochromosomes. The tool runs on a dual mode as defined by the user: a 'quick mode' to identify presence of HPV types and an 'integration mode' to determine genomic location for the site of integration. The input data can be a paired-end whole-exome, whole-genome or whole-transcriptome data set. The HPVDetector is available in public domain for download: http://www.actrec.gov.in/pi-webpages/AmitDutt/HPVdetector/HPVDetector.html.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: On the basis of our evaluation of 116 whole-exome, 23 whole-transcriptome and 2 whole-genome data, we were able to identify presence of HPV in 20 exomes and 4 transcriptomes of cervical and head and neck cancer tumour samples. Using the inbuilt annotation module of HPVDetector, we found predominant integration of viral gene E7, a known oncogene, at known 17q21, 3q27, 7q35, Xq28 and novel sites of integration in the human genome. Furthermore, co-infection with high-risk HPVs such as 16 and 31 were found to be mutually exclusive compared with low-risk HPV71.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: HPVDetector is a simple yet precise and robust tool for detecting HPV from tumour samples using variety of next-generation sequencing platforms including whole genome, whole exome and transcriptome. Two different modes (quick detection and integration mode) along with a GUI widen the usability of HPVDetector for biologists and clinicians with minimal computational knowledge.},

@article{Skewes-Cox2014,
abstract = {Rapid, sensitive, and specific virus detection is an important component of clinical diagnostics. Massively parallel sequencing enables new diagnostic opportunities that complement traditional serological and PCR based techniques. While massively parallel sequencing promises the benefits of being more comprehensive and less biased than traditional approaches, it presents new analytical challenges, especially with respect to detection of pathogen sequences in metagenomic contexts. To a first approximation, the initial detection of viruses can be achieved simply through alignment of sequence reads or assembled contigs to a reference database of pathogen genomes with tools such as BLAST. However, recognition of highly divergent viral sequences is problematic, and may be further complicated by the inherently high mutation rates of some viral types, especially RNA viruses. In these cases, increased sensitivity may be achieved by leveraging position-specific information during the alignment process. Here, we constructed HMMER3-compatible profile hidden Markov models (profile HMMs) from all the virally annotated proteins in RefSeq in an automated fashion using a custom-built bioinformatic pipeline. We then tested the ability of these viral profile HMMs (“vFams”) to accurately classify sequences as viral or non-viral. Cross-validation experiments with full-length gene sequences showed that the vFams were able to recall 91{\%} of left-out viral test sequences without erroneously classifying any non-viral sequences into viral protein clusters. Thorough reanalysis of previously published metagenomic datasets with a set of the best-performing vFams showed that they were more sensitive than BLAST for detecting sequences originating from more distant relatives of known viruses. To facilitate the use of the vFams for rapid detection of remote viral homologs in metagenomic data, we provide two sets of vFams, comprising more than 4,000 vFams each, in the HMMER3 format. We also provide the software necessary to build custom profile HMMs or update the vFams as more viruses are discovered (http://derisilab.ucsf.edu/software/vFam).},

abstract = {Although next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been the domain of large genome centers, it is quickly becoming more accessible to general pathology laboratories. In addition to finding single-base changes, NGS allows for the detection of larger structural variants, including insertions/deletions, translocations, and viral insertions. We describe the use of targeted NGS on DNA extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded (FFPE) tissue, and show that the short read lengths of NGS are ideally suited to fragmented DNA obtained from FFPE tissue. Further, we describe a novel method for performing hybrid-capture target enrichment using PCR-generated capture probes. As amodel, we captured the 5.3-kb Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) genome in FFPE cases of Merkel cell carcinoma using inexpensive, PCR-derived capture probes, and achieved up to 37,000-fold coverage of the MCPyV genome without prior virus-specific PCR amplification. This depth of coverage made it possible to reproducibly detect viral genome deletions and insertion sites anywhere within the human genome. Out of four cases sequenced, we identified the 5= insertion sites in four of four cases and the 3= sites in three of four cases. These findings demonstrate the potential for an inexpensive gene targeting and NGS method that can be easily adapted for use with FFPE tissue to identify large structural rearrangements, opening up the possibility for further discovery from archival tissue.},

abstract = {The development of genomic instability is a hallmark of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) associated cervical carcinogenesis. We have previously shown that the HPV-16 E7 oncoprotein rapidly subverts mi-totic fidelity by inducing abnormal centrosome numbers and multipolar mitotic spindles. Here we report that expression of HPV-16 E6 and E7 independently results in various mitotic abnormalities. HPV-16 E6 and E7 were each associated with unaligned or lagging chromosomal material, indicating relaxation of spindle checkpoint control. Moreover, by over-whelming checkpoint control mechanisms that may prevent cells with multiple spindle poles to enter anaphase, expression of HPV-16 E6 and E7 leads to a small but significant number of cells with altered polarity at later stages of the cell division process. In addition to changes that have the potential to give rise to numerical chromosome imbalances, we dis-covered that expression of HPV-16 E7 could trigger anaphase bridge formation to an extent similar to that of high-risk HPV E6. Anaphase bridges typically develop after chromosomal breaks and alterations of chromosomal structure. Further investigation of mechanisms by which HPV-16 E6 and E7 contribute to the destabilization of the host cell genome revealed that both high-risk HPV oncoproteins induce DNA damage. Moreover, expression of HPV-16 E7 was associated with an increased number of cells exhibiting nuclear foci of phosphorylated his-tone H2AX as well as activation of cell cycle checkpoints triggered by DNA repair. Our results therefore suggest that HPV oncoproteins are a source for both numerical and structural chromosome instability during HPV-associated carcinogenesis.},

Here, we describe the biological activities of the best-studied E5 proteins and discuss the evidence implicating specific protein targets and pathways in mediating these activities. The primary target of the 44-amino acid BPV1 E5 protein is the PDGF ?? receptor, whereas the EGF receptor appears to be an important target of the 83-amino acid HPV16 E5 protein. Both E5 proteins also bind to the vacuolar ATPase and affect MHC class I expression and cell-cell communication.

abstract = {Integration of the viral DNA into host chromosomes was found in most of the hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). Here we devised a massive anchored parallel sequencing (MAPS) method using next-generation sequencing to isolate and sequence HBV integrants. Applying MAPS to 40 pairs of HBV-related HCC tissues (cancer and adjacent tissues), we identified 296 HBV integration events corresponding to 286 unique integration sites (UISs) with precise HBV-Human DNA junctions. HBV integration favored chromosome 17 and preferentially integrated into human transcript units. HBV targeted genes were enriched in GO terms: cAMP metabolic processes, T cell differentiation and activation, TGF beta receptor pathway, ncRNA catabolic process, and dsRNA fragmentation and cellular response to dsRNA. The HBV targeted genes include 7 genes (PTPRJ, CNTN6, IL12B, MYOM1, FNDC3B, LRFN2, FN1) containing IPR003961 (Fibronectin, type III domain), 7 genes (NRG3, MASP2, NELL1, LRP1B, ADAM21, NRXN1, FN1) containing IPR013032 (EGF-like region, conserved site), and three genes (PDE7A, PDE4B, PDE11A) containing IPR002073 (3', 5'-cyclic-nucleotide phosphodiesterase). Enriched pathways include hsa04512 (ECM-receptor interaction), hsa04510 (Focal adhesion), and hsa04012 (ErbB signaling pathway). Fewer integration events were found in cancers compared to cancer-adjacent tissues, suggesting a clonal expansion model in HCC development. Finally, we identified 8 genes that were recurrent target genes by HBV integration including fibronectin 1 (FN1) and telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT1), two known recurrent target genes, and additional novel target genes such as SMAD family member 5 (SMAD5), phosphatase and actin regulator 4 (PHACTR4), and RNA binding protein fox-1 homolog (C. elegans) 1 (RBFOX1). Integrating analysis with recently published whole-genome sequencing analysis, we identified 14 additional recurrent HBV target genes, greatly expanding the HBV recurrent target list. This global survey of HBV integration events, together with recently published whole-genome sequencing analyses, furthered our understanding of the HBV-related HCC.},

@article{Eddy2011,
abstract = {Profile hidden Markov models (profile HMMs) and probabilistic inference methods have made important contributions to the theory of sequence database homology search. However, practical use of profile HMM methods has been hindered by the computational expense of existing software implementations. Here I describe an acceleration heuristic for profile HMMs, the "multiple segment Viterbi" (MSV) algorithm. The MSV algorithm computes an optimal sum of multiple ungapped local alignment segments using a striped vector-parallel approach previously described for fast Smith/Waterman alignment. MSV scores follow the same statistical distribution as gapped optimal local alignment scores, allowing rapid evaluation of significance of an MSV score and thus facilitating its use as a heuristic filter. I also describe a 20-fold acceleration of the standard profile HMM Forward/Backward algorithms using a method I call "sparse rescaling". These methods are assembled in a pipeline in which high-scoring MSV hits are passed on for reanalysis with the full HMM Forward/Backward algorithm. This accelerated pipeline is implemented in the freely available HMMER3 software package. Performance benchmarks show that the use of the heuristic MSV filter sacrifices negligible sensitivity compared to unaccelerated profile HMM searches. HMMER3 is substantially more sensitive and 100- to 1000-fold faster than HMMER2. HMMER3 is now about as fast as BLAST for protein searches.},

@article{Forster2015,
abstract = {Several pathogenic viruses such as hepatitis B and human immunodeficiency viruses may integrate into the host genome. These virus/host integrations are detectable using paired-end next generation sequencing. However, the low number of expected true virus integrations may be difficult to distinguish from the noise of many false positive candidates. Here, we propose a novel filtering approach that increases specificity without compromising sensitivity for virus/host chimera detection. Our detection pipeline termed Vy-PER (Virus integration detection bY Paired End Reads) outperforms existing similar tools in speed and accuracy. We analysed whole genome data from childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), which is characterised by genomic rearrangements and usually associated with radiation exposure. This analysis was motivated by the recently reported virus integrations at genomic rearrangement sites and association with chromosomal instability in liver cancer. However, as expected, our analysis of 20 tumour and matched germline genomes from ALL patients finds no significant evidence for integrations by known viruses. Nevertheless, our method eliminates 12,800 false positives per genome (80× coverage) and only our method detects singleton human-phiX174-chimeras caused by optical errors of the Illumina HiSeq platform. This high accuracy is useful for detecting low virus integration levels as well as non-integrated viruses.},

@article{Gasior2006,
abstract = {Long interspersed element-1 (L1) is an autonomous retroelement that is active in the human genome. The proposed mechanism of insertion for L1 suggests that cleavage of both strands of genomic DNA is required. We demonstrate that L1 expression leads to a high level of double-strand break (DSB) formation in DNA using immunolocalization of $\gamma$-H2AX foci and the COMET assay. Similar to its role in mediating DSB repair in response to radiation, ATM is required for L1-induced $\gamma$-H2AX foci and for L1 retrotransposition. This is the first characterization of a DNA repair response from expression of a non-long terminal repeat (non-LTR) retrotransposon in mammalian cells as well as the first demonstration that a host DNA repair gene is required for successful integration. Notably, the number of L1-induced DSBs is greater than the predicted numbers of successful insertions, suggesting a significant degree of inefficiency during the integration process. This result suggests that the endonuclease activity of endogenously expressed L1 elements could contribute to DSB formation in germ-line and somatic tissues. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Beyond recalculating frequencies for the previously reported frequent integration sites POU5F1B (9.7{\%}), FHIT (8.7{\%}), KLF12 (7.8{\%}), KLF5 (6.8{\%}), LRP1B (5.8{\%}) and LEPREL1 (4.9{\%}), we discovered new hot spots HMGA2 (7.8{\%}), DLG2 (4.9{\%}) and SEMA3D (4.9{\%}). Protein expression from FHIT and LRP1B was downregulated when HPV integrated in their introns. Protein expression from MYC and HMGA2 was elevated when HPV integrated into flanking regions. Moreover, microhomologous sequence between the human and HPV genomes was significantly enriched near integration breakpoints, indicating that fusion between viral and human DNA may have occurred by microhomology-mediated DNA repair pathways.

However, nothing is known about effects of L1 retrotransposition on cell growth and differentiation. To investigate the potential for such biological effects and the impact that human L1 retrotransposition has upon cancer cell growth, we examined a panel of human L1 transformed cell lines following a complete retrotransposition process. The results demonstrated that transposition of L1 leads to the activation of the p53 -mediated apoptotic pathway in human cancer cells that possess a wild-type p53 . In addition, we found that inactivation of p53 in cells, where L1 was undergoing retrotransposition, inhibited the induction of apoptosis. This suggests an association between active retrotransposition and a competent p53 response in which induction of apoptosis is a major outcome. These data are consistent with a model in which human retrotransposition is sensed by the cell as a “genetic damaging event” and that massive retrotransposition triggers signaling pathways resulting in apoptosis.},

In this study, we demonstrate that integration of HPV-16 DNA leads to increased steady-state levels of mRNAs encoding the viral oncogenes E6 and E7. This increase is shown to result, at least in part, from an increased stability of E6 and E7 mRNAs that arise specifically from those integrated viral genomes disrupted in the 3' untranslated region of the viral early region. Further, we demonstrate that the A+U-rich element within this viral early 3' untranslated region confers instability on a heterologous mRNA. We conclude that integration of HPV-16 DNA, as occurs in cervical cancers, can result in the increased expression of the viral E6 and E7 oncogenes through altered mRNA stability.},

The ability of these viruses to cause disease is partly attributed to the strict coordination of viral gene expression with the differentiation stage of the infected cell. HPV gene expression is regulated temporally at the level of RNA splicing and polyadenylation, and a dysregulated gene expression programme allows some HPV types to establish long-term persistence, which is a risk factor for cancer. In this Review, we summarize the role of splicing and polyadenylation in the regulation of HPV gene expression and discuss the viral and cellular factors that control these processes.},

abstract = {Retrotransposons are repetitive DNA sequences that are positioned throughout the human genome. Retrotransposons are capable of copying themselves and mobilizing new copies to novel genomic locations in a process called retrotransposition. While most retrotransposon sequences in the human genome are incomplete and incapable of mobilization, the LINE-1 retrotransposon, which comprises ∼17{\%} of the human genome, remains active. The disruption of cellular mechanisms that suppress retrotransposon activity is linked to the generation of aneuploidy, a potential driver of tumor development. When retrotransposons insert into a novel genomic region, they have the potential to disrupt the coding sequence of endogenous genes and alter gene expression, which can lead to deleterious consequences for the organism. Additionally, increased LINE-1 copy numbers provide more chances for recombination events to occur between retrotransposons, which can lead to chromosomal breaks and rearrangements. LINE-1 activity is increased in various cancer cell lines and in patient tissues resected from primary tumors. LINE-1 activity also correlates with increased cancer metastasis. This review aims to give a brief overview of the connections between LINE-1 retrotransposition and the loss of genome stability. We will also discuss the mechanisms that repress retrotransposition in human cells and their links to cancer. THE LINE-1 RETROTRANSPOSON IS AN ACTIVE MOBILE ELEMENT Retrotransposons, a class of transposable elements (TE), are highly repetitive DNA sequences positioned throughout the human genome. These structural elements make use of an RNA-mediated transposition process, allowing them to move from one location in the genome to another, while the original copy remains in its original locus. The RNA-based retrotransposons are classified into the autonomous long terminal repeat (LTR) and the non-LTR containing retrotransposons. LTR containing retrotransposons, as their name implies, possess LTRs ranging from 100 bp to over 5 kb in size and are endogenous retroviruses. Long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs), comprising 20{\%} of the human genome are a type of non-LTR retrotransposon. Non-autonomous retrotransposons are a third class of retrotransposons, of which the short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) comprise ∼13{\%} of the human genome (Lander et al., 2001). The human genome contains millions of copies of retrotransposons; however, only a single non-LTR retrotransposon family, the LINE-1 (L1) family, remains the primary source of},

abstract = {HISAT (hierarchical indexing for spliced alignment of transcripts) is a highly efficient system for aligning reads from RNA sequencing experiments. HISAT uses an indexing scheme based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform and the Ferragina-Manzini (FM) index, employing two types of indexes for alignment: a whole-genome FM index to anchor each alignment and numerous local FM indexes for very rapid extensions of these alignments. HISAT's hierarchical index for the human genome contains 48,000 local FM indexes, each representing a genomic region of ∼64,000 bp. Tests on real and simulated data sets showed that HISAT is the fastest system currently available, with equal or better accuracy than any other method. Despite its large number of indexes, HISAT requires only 4.3 gigabytes of memory. HISAT supports genomes of any size, including those larger than 4 billion bases.},

@article{Kinomoto2007,
abstract = {Approximately 17{\%} of the human genome is comprised of long interspersed nuclear element 1 (LINE-1, L1) non-LTR retrotransposons. L1 retrotransposition is known to be the cause of several genetic diseases, such as hemophilia A, Duchene muscular dystrophy, and so on. The L1 retroelements are also able to cause colon cancer, suggesting that L1 transposition could occur not only in germ cells, but also in somatic cells if innate immunity would not function appropriately. The mechanisms of L1 transposition restriction in the normal cells, however, are not fully defined. We here show that antiretroviral innate proteins, human APOBEC3 (hA3) family members, from hA3A to hA3H, differentially reduce the level of L1 retrotransposition that does not correlate either with antiviral activity against Vif-deficient HIV-1 and murine leukemia virus, or with patterns of subcellular localization. Importantly, hA3G protein inhibits L1 retrotransposition, in striking contrast to the recent reports. Inhibitory effect of hA3 family members on L1 transposition might not be due to deaminase activity, but due to novel mechanism(s). Thus, we conclude that all hA3 proteins act to differentially suppress uncontrolled transposition of L1 elements.},

abstract = {Analyzing vertebrate genomes requires rapid mRNA/DNA and cross-species protein alignments. A new tool, BLAT, is more accurate and 500 times faster than popular existing tools for mRNA/DNA alignments and 50 times faster for protein alignments at sensitivity settings typically used when comparing vertebrate sequences. BLAT's speed stems from an index of all nonoverlapping K-mers in the genome. This index fits inside the RAM of inexpensive computers, and need only be computed once for each genome assembly. BLAT has several major stages. It uses the index to find regions in the genome likely to be homologous to the query sequence. It performs an alignment between homologous regions. It stitches together these aligned regions (often exons) into larger alignments (typically genes). Finally, BLAT revisits small internal exons possibly missed at the first stage and adjusts large gap boundaries that have canonical splice sites where feasible. This paper describes how BLAT was optimized. Effects on speed and sensitivity are explored for various K-mer sizes, mismatch schemes, and number of required index matches. BLAT is compared with other alignment programs on various test sets and then used in several genome-wide applications. http://genome.ucsc.edu hosts a web-based BLAT server for the human genome.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Although the role of human papilloma virus (HPV) in cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) is well established, the role in head and neck SCC (HNSCC) is less clear. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have a role in the cancer development, and HPV status may affect the miRNA expression pattern in HNSCC. To explore the influence of HPV in HNSCC, we made a comparative miRNA profile of HPV-positive (HPV+) and HPV-negative (HPV-) HNSCC against CSCC. METHODS Fresh frozen and laser microdissected-paraffin-embedded samples obtained from patients with HPV+/HPV- HNSCC, CSCC and controls were used for microarray analysis. Differentially expressed miRNAs in the HPV+ and HPV- HNSCC samples were compared with the differentially expressed miRNAs in the CSCC samples. RESULTS Human papilloma virus positive (+) HNSCC had a distinct miRNA profile compared with HPV- HNSCC. Significantly more similarity was seen between HPV+ HNSCC and CSCC than HPV- and CSCC. A set of HPV core miRNAs were identified. Of these especially the miR-15a/miR-16/miR195/miR-497 family, miR-143/miR-145 and the miR-106-363 cluster appear to be important within the known HPV pathogenesis. CONCLUSION This study adds new knowledge to the known pathogenic pathways of HPV and substantiates the oncogenic role of HPV in subsets of HNSCCs.},

abstract = {The mutagenic effect of hepatitis B (HBV) integration in predisposing risk to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains elusive. In this study, we performed transcriptome sequencing of HBV-positive HCC cell lines and showed transcription of viral-human gene fusions from the site of genome integrations. We discovered tumor-promoting properties of a chimeric HBx-LINE1 that, intriguingly, functions as a hybrid RNA. HBx-LINE1 can be detected in 23.3{\%} of HBV-associated HCC tumors and correlates with poorer patient survival. HBx-LINE1 transgenic mice showed heightened susceptibility to diethylnitrosamine-induced tumor formation. We further show that HBx-LINE1 expression affects ??-catenin transactivity, which underlines a role in activating Wnt signaling. Thus, this study identifies a viral-human chimeric fusion transcript that functions like a long noncoding RNA to promote HCC. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

The Cancer Genome Atlas profiled 279 head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) to provide a comprehensive landscape of somatic genomic alterations. Here we show that human-papillomavirus-associated tumours are dominated by helical domain mutations of the oncogene PIK3CA, novel alterations involving loss of TRAF3, and amplification of the cell cycle gene E2F1. Smoking-related HNSCCs demonstrate near universal loss-of-function TP53 mutations and CDKN2A inactivation with frequent copy number alterations including amplification of 3q26/28 and 11q13/22. A subgroup of oral cavity tumours with favourable clinical outcomes displayed infrequent copy number alterations in conjunction with activating mutations of HRAS or PIK3CA, coupled with inactivating mutations of CASP8, NOTCH1 and TP53. Other distinct subgroups contained loss-of-function alterations of the chromatin modifier NSD1, WNT pathway genes AJUBA and FAT1, and activation of oxidative stress factor NFE2L2, mainly in laryngeal tumours. Therapeutic candidate alterations were identified in most HNSCCs.},

abstract = {The small DNA tumor viruses, Polyoma virus, Simian Vacuolating Virus 40, the Papilloma viruses and the human Adenoviruses, were first described during a period of intense virus discovery (1930-1960s) and shown to produce tumors in animals. In each of these cases the viral DNA was shown to persist (commonly integrated into a host chromosome) and only a selected portion of this DNA was expressed as m-RNA and proteins in these cancers. The viral encoded tumor antigens were identified and shown to be required to both establish the tumor and maintain the transformed cell phenotype. The functions of these viral tumor antigens were explored and shown to have common features and mechanisms even though they appear to have evolved from diverse genes. The SV40 large tumor antigen, the human Papilloma virus E7 protein and the Adenovirus E1A protein were shown to bind to and inactivate the functions of the Retinoblastoma proteins in transformed cells. This resulted in the activation of the E2F and DP transcription factors and the entry of cells into the S-phase of DNA synthesis which was required for viral DNA replication. These events triggered the activation of p53 which promotes apoptosis of these virus infected cells limiting virus replication and tumor formation. These viruses responded by evolving and producing the SV40 large tumor antigen, the human Papilloma virus E6 protein and the Adenovirus E1b-55Kd protein which binds to and inactivates the p53 functions in both the infected cells and transformed cells. Some of the human Papilloma viruses and one of the Polyoma viruses have been shown to cause selected cancers in humans. Both the p53 tumor suppressor gene, which was uncovered in the studies with these viruses, and the retinoblastoma protein, have been shown to play a central role in the origins of human cancers via both somatic and germ line mutations in those genes. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

A first generation of hash table-based methods has been developed, including MAQ, which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from a single individual. However, MAQ does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. BWA supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that BWA is approximately 10-20x faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition, BWA outputs alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format. Variant calling and other downstream analyses after the alignment can be achieved with the open source SAMtools software package.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY: http://maq.sourceforge.net.},

abstract = {Elucidation of tumor-DNA virus associations in many cancer types has enhanced our knowledge of fundamental oncogenesis mechanisms and provided a basis for cancer prevention initiatives. RNA-Seq is a novel tool to comprehensively assess such associations. We interrogated RNA-Seq data from 3,775 malignant neoplasms in The Cancer Genome Atlas database for the presence of viral sequences. Viral integration sites were also detected in expressed transcripts using a novel approach. The detection capacity of RNA-Seq was compared to available clinical laboratory data. Human papillomavirus (HPV) transcripts were detected using RNA-Seq analysis in head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma, uterine endometrioid carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Detection of HPV by RNA-Seq correlated with detection by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry in squamous cell carcinoma tumors of the head and neck. Hepatitis B virus and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) were detected using RNA-Seq in hepatocellular carcinoma and gastric carcinoma tumors, respectively. Integration sites of viral genes and oncogenes were detected in cancers harboring HPV or hepatitis B virus but not in EBV-positive gastric carcinoma. Integration sites of expressed viral transcripts frequently involved known coding areas of the host genome. No DNA virus transcripts were detected in acute myeloid leukemia, cutaneous melanoma, low- and high-grade gliomas of the brain, and adenocarcinomas of the breast, colon and rectum, lung, prostate, ovary, kidney, and thyroid. In conclusion, this study provides a large-scale overview of the landscape of DNA viruses in human malignant cancers. While further validation is necessary for specific cancer types, our findings highlight the utility of RNA-Seq in detecting tumor-associated DNA viruses and identifying viral integration sites that may unravel novel mechanisms of cancer pathogenesis.},

abstract = {Background {\&} Aims Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers have a high risk to develop hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Recent studies suggest that viral-human hybrid RNA transcripts, which play a critical role in promoting HCC progression, may be the molecules responsible for the development of HCC in HBV infected patients. Here we determine whether HBx-LINE1, a hybrid RNA transcript of the human LINE1 and the HBV-encoded X gene generated in tumor cells of HBV-positive HCC, can serve as a molecular sponge for sequestering miR-122 and promoting liver cell abnormal mitosis and mouse hepatic injury. Methods Paired tumor and distal normal liver tissue specimens, as well as HBx-LINE1 overexpressing hepatic cells, were used to test the relationship between HBx-LINE1 and miR-122. Levels of HBx-LINE1 and miR-122 were assayed by qRT-PCR and Northern blot. HBx-LINE1-miR-122 binding was analyzed by luciferase reporter assay. Mouse hepatic injury was monitored by tissue staining and serum aspartate transaminase, alanine aminotransferase and total bilirubin measurement. Results HBx-LINE1 in HBV-positive HCC tissues was inversely correlated with miR-122. Each HBx-LINE1 consists of six miR-122-binding sites, and forced expression of HBx-LINE1 effectively depleted cellular miR-122, promoting hepatic cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like changes, including $\beta$-catenin signaling activation, E-cadherin reduction and cell migration enhancement. Mice administered with HBx-LINE1 display a significant mouse liver cell abnormal mitosis and hepatic injury. However, all these effects of HBx-LINE1 are completely abolished by miR-122. Conclusions Our finding illustrates a previously uncharacterized miR-122-sequestering mechanism by which HBx-LINE1 promotes hepatic cell EMT-like changes and mouse liver injury.},

@article{Matsen2010a,
abstract = {Background: Likelihood-based phylogenetic inference is generally considered to be the most reliable classification method for unknown sequences. However, traditional likelihood-based phylogenetic methods cannot be applied to large volumes of short reads from next-generation sequencing due to computational complexity issues and lack of phylogenetic signal. "Phylogenetic placement," where a reference tree is fixed and the unknown query sequences are placed onto the tree via a reference alignment, is a way to bring the inferential power offered by likelihood-based approaches to large data sets. Results: This paper introduces pplacer, a software package for phylogenetic placement and subsequent visualization. The algorithm can place twenty thousand short reads on a reference tree of one thousand taxa per hour per processor, has essentially linear time and memory complexity in the number of reference taxa, and is easy to run in parallel. Pplacer features calculation of the posterior probability of a placement on an edge, which is a statistically rigorous way of quantifying uncertainty on an edge-by-edge basis. It also can inform the user of the positional uncertainty for query sequences by calculating expected distance between placement locations, which is crucial in the estimation of uncertainty with a well-sampled reference tree. The software provides visualizations using branch thickness and color to represent number of placements and their uncertainty. A simulation study using reads generated from 631 COG alignments shows a high level of accuracy for phylogenetic placement over a wide range of alignment diversity, and the power of edge uncertainty estimates to measure placement confidence. Conclusions: Pplacer enables efficient phylogenetic placement and subsequent visualization, making likelihood-based phylogenetics methodology practical for large collections of reads; it is freely available as source code, binaries, and a web service.},

Human viral oncogenesis is complex, and only a small percentage of the infected individuals develop cancer, often many years to decades after the initial infection.

@article{Mirarab2012,
abstract = {We address the problem of Phylogenetic Placement, in which the objective is to insert short molecular sequences (called query sequences) into an existing phylogenetic tree and alignment on full-length sequences for the same gene. Phylogenetic placement has the potential to provide information beyond pure "species identification" (i.e., the association of metagenomic reads to existing species), because it can also give information about the evolutionary relationships between these query sequences and to known species. Approaches for phylogenetic placement have been developed that operate in two steps: first, an alignment is estimated for each query sequence to the alignment of the full-length sequences, and then that alignment is used to find the optimal location in the phylogenetic tree for the query sequence. Recent methods of this type include HMMALIGN+EPA, HMMALIGN+pplacer, and PaPaRa+EPA.We report on a study evaluating phylogenetic placement methods on biological and simulated data. This study shows that these methods have extremely good accuracy and computational tractability under conditions where the input contains a highly accurate alignment and tree for the full-length sequences, and the set of full-length sequences is sufficiently small and not too evolutionarily diverse; however, we also show that under other conditions accuracy declines and the computational requirements for memory and time exceed acceptable limits. We present SEPP, a general "boosting" technique to improve the accuracy and/or speed of phylogenetic placement techniques. The key algorithmic aspect of this booster is a dataset decomposition technique in SAT{\'{e}}, a method that utilizes an iterative divide-and-conquer technique to co-estimate alignments and trees on large molecular sequence datasets. We show that SAT{\'{e}}-boosting improves HMMALIGN+pplacer, placing short sequences more accurately when the set of input sequences has a large evolutionary diameter and produces placements of comparable accuracy in a fraction of the time for easier cases. SEPP software and the datasets used in this study are all available for free at http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/phylo/software/sepp/submission.},

@article{Park1998,
abstract = {The sequences of related proteins can diverge beyond the point where their relationship can be recognised by pairwise sequence comparisons. In attempts to overcome this limitation, methods have been developed that use as a query, not a single sequence, but sets of related sequences or a representation of the characteristics shared by related sequences. Here we describe an assessment of three of these methods: the SAM-T98 implementation of a hidden Markov model procedure; PSI-BLAST; and the intermediate sequence search (ISS) procedure. We determined the extent to which these procedures can detect evolutionary relationships between the members of the sequence database PDBD40-J. This database, derived from the structural classification of proteins (SCOP), contains the sequences of proteins of known structure whose sequence identities with each other are 40{\%} or less. The evolutionary relationships that exist between those that have low sequence identities were found by the examination of their structural details and, in many cases, their functional features. For nine false positive predictions out of a possible 432,680, i.e. at a false positive rate of about 1/50,000, SAM-T98 found 35{\%} of the true homologous relationships in PDBD40-J, whilst PSI-BLAST found 30{\%} and ISS found 25{\%}. Overall, this is about twice the number of PDBD40-J relations that can be detected by the pairwise comparison procedures FASTA (17{\%}) and GAP-BLAST (15{\%}). For distantly related sequences in PDBD40-J, those pairs whose sequence identity is less than 30{\%}, SAM-T98 and PSI-BLAST detect three times the number of relationships found by the pairwise methods.},

RNA-seq experiments generate very large, complex data sets that demand fast, accurate and flexible software to reduce the raw read data to comprehensible results. HISAT (hierarchical indexing for spliced alignment of transcripts), StringTie and Ballgown are free, open-source software tools for comprehensive analysis of RNA-seq experiments. Together, they allow scientists to align reads to a genome, assemble transcripts including novel splice variants, compute the abundance of these transcripts in each sample and compare experiments to identify differentially expressed genes and transcripts. This protocol describes all the steps necessary to process a large set of raw sequencing reads and create lists of gene transcripts, expression levels, and differentially expressed genes and transcripts. The protocol's execution time depends on the computing resources, but it typically takes under 45 min of computer time.

We introduce StringTie, a computational method that applies a network flow algorithm originally developed in optimization theory, together with optional de novo assembly, to assemble these complex data sets into transcripts. When used to analyze both simulated and real data sets, StringTie produces more complete and accurate reconstructions of genes and better estimates of expression levels, compared with other leading transcript assembly programs including Cufflinks, IsoLasso, Scripture and Traph. For example, on 90 million reads from human blood, StringTie correctly assembled 10,990 transcripts, whereas the next best assembly was of 7,187 transcripts by Cufflinks, which is a 53{\%} increase in transcripts assembled. On a simulated data set, StringTie correctly assembled 7,559 transcripts, which is 20{\%} more than the 6,310 assembled by Cufflinks. As well as producing a more complete transcriptome assembly, StringTie runs faster on all data sets tested to date compared with other assembly software, including Cufflinks.},

abstract = {To determine whether integration of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA sequences could lead to the deregulation of genes implied in oncogenesis, we analysed the HPV integration sites in a series of nine cell lines derived from invasive genital carcinomas. Using in situ hybridization, HPV16 or 18 sequences were found at chromosome band 8q24, the localization of MYC, in IC1, IC2, IC3, IC6 and CAC-1 cells and at other sites in IC4, IC5, IC7 and IC8 cells. We then localized viral sequences at the molecular level and searched for alterations of MYC structure and expression in these cells. MYC genomic status and viral integration sites were also analysed in primary tumors from which IC1, IC2, IC3 and IC6 cells were derived. In IC1, IC2 and CAC-1 cells, HPV DNA was located within 58 kb of MYC, downstream, upstream, or within MYC. In IC3 and IC6 cells, HPV DNA was located 400-500 kb upstream of MYC. Amplification studies showed that, in IC1, IC2 and IC3, viral and MYC sequences were co-amplified in an amplicon between less than 50 and 800 kb in size. MYC amplification was also observed in primary tumors, indicating that this genetic alteration, together with viral insertion at the MYC locus, had already taken place in vivo. MYC was not amplified in the other cell lines. MYC mRNA and protein overexpression was observed in the five cell lines in which the HPV DNA was inserted close to the MYC locus, but in none of the lines where the insertion had occurred at other sites. MYC activation, triggered by the insertion of HPV DNA sequences, can be an important genetic event in cervical oncogenesis.},

@article{Plummer2016,
abstract = {Background Infections with certain viruses, bacteria, and parasites are strong risk factors for specific cancers. As new cancer statistics and epidemiological findings have accumulated in the past 5 years, we aimed to assess the causal involvement of the main carcinogenic agents in different cancer types for the year 2012. Methods We considered ten infectious agents classified as carcinogenic to human beings by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. We calculated the number of new cancer cases in 2012 attributable to infections by country, by combining cancer incidence estimates (from GLOBOCAN 2012) with estimates of attributable fraction (AF) for the infectious agents. AF estimates were calculated from the prevalence of infection in cancer cases and the relative risk for the infection (for some sites). Estimates of infection prevalence, relative risk, and corresponding 95{\%} CIs for AF were obtained from systematic reviews and pooled analyses. Findings Of 14 million new cancer cases in 2012, 2??2 million (15??4{\%}) were attributable to carcinogenic infections. The most important infectious agents worldwide were Helicobacter pylori (770???000 cases), human papillomavirus (640???000), hepatitis B virus (420???000), hepatitis C virus (170???000), and Epstein-Barr virus (120???000). Kaposi's sarcoma was the second largest contributor to the cancer burden in sub-Saharan Africa. The AFs for infection varied by country and development status???from less than 5{\%} in the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and some countries in western and northern Europe to more than 50{\%} in some countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Interpretation A large potential exists for reducing the burden of cancer caused by infections. Socioeconomic development is associated with a decrease in infection-associated cancers; however, to reduce the incidence of these cancers without delay, population-based vaccination and screen-and-treat programmes should be made accessible and available.

L1 somatic insertions have the potential to disrupt the transcriptome by inserting into or nearby genes. By mutating genes and playing a role in epigenetic dysregulation, L1 transposons may contribute to tumorigenesis. Studies of the ‘‘mobi- lome'' have lagged behind other tumor characterizations at the sequence, transcript, and epigenetic levels.

abstract = {Integration of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA into the host genome is a critical aetiological event in the progression from normal cervix to intraepithelial neoplasm, and finally to invasive cervical cancer. However, there has been little work on how HPV integration status relates to treatment outcome for cervical carcinomas. In the current study, HPV E2 and E6 gene copy numbers were measured in 111 cervical cancer tissues using real-time QPCR. Integration patterns were divided into four groups: single copy-integrated with episomal components (group 1), single copy-integrated without episomal components (group 2), multicopy tandem repetition-integrated (group 3), and low HPV (group 4) groups. A relapse-predicting model was constructed using multivariable Cox proportional hazards model to classify patients into different risk groups for disease-free survival (DFS). The model was internally validated using bootstrap resampling. Oligonucleotide microarray analysis was performed to evaluate gene expression patterns in relation to the different integration groups. DFS rate was inferior in the order of the patients in group 4, group 2/3, and group 1. Multivariate analysis showed that histologic grade, clinical stage group, and integration pattern were significant prognostic factors for poor DFS. The current prognostic model accurately predicted the risk of relapse, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.74 (bootstrap corrected, 0.71). In conclusion, these data suggest that HPV integration pattern is a potent prognostic factor for tailored treatment of cervical cancer.},

@article{Sigurdsson2012,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: A defense system against transposon activity in the human germline based on PIWI proteins and piRNA has recently been discovered. It represses the activity of LINE-1 elements via DNA methylation by a largely unknown mechanism. Based on the dispersed distribution of clusters of piRNA genes in a strand-specific manner on all human chromosomes, we hypothesized that this system might work preferentially on local and proximal sequences. We tested this hypothesis with a methylation-associated SNP (mSNP) marker which is based on the density of C-T transitions in CpG dinucleotides as a surrogate marker for germline methylation. RESULTS: We found significantly higher density of mSNPs flanking piRNA clusters in the human genome for flank sizes of 1-16 Mb. A dose-response relationship between number of piRNA genes and mSNP density was found for up to 16 Mb of flanking sequences. The chromosomal density of hypermethylated LINE-1 elements had a significant positive correlation with the chromosomal density of piRNA genes (r = 0.41, P = 0.05). Genome windows of 1-16 Mb containing piRNA clusters had significantly more hypermethylated LINE-1 elements than windows not containing piRNA clusters. Finally, the minimum distance to the next piRNA cluster was significantly shorter for hypermethylated LINE-1 compared to normally methylated elements (14.4 Mb vs 16.1 Mb). CONCLUSIONS: Our observations support our hypothesis that the piRNA-PIWI system preferentially methylates sequences in close proximity to the piRNA clusters and perhaps physically adjacent sequences on other chromosomes. Furthermore they suggest that this proximity effect extends up to 16 Mb. This could be due to an unknown localization signal, transcription of piRNA genes near the nuclear membrane or the presence of an unknown RNA molecule that spreads across the chromosome and targets the methylation directed by the piRNA-PIWI complex. Our data suggest a region specific molecular mechanism which can be sought experimentally.},

abstract = {Malignancy results from a complex combination of genetic and epigenetic changes, the full effects of which are still largely unknown. Here we summarize current knowledge of the origin, retrotranspositional activity, epigenetic state, and transcription of human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs), and then discuss the potential effects of their deregulation in cancer. Evidence suggests that cancer-associated epigenetic changes most likely underlie potential HERV-mediated effects on genome and transcriptome instability and may play a role in malignancy. Despite our currently limited understanding of the importance of HERVs or other transposable elements in cancer development, we believe that the emerging era of high-throughput sequencing of cancer genomes, epigenomes, and transcriptomes will provide unprecedented opportunities to investigate these roles in the future. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Schmitz2012,
abstract = {HPV DNA integration into the host genome is a characteristic but not an exclusive step during cervical carcinogenesis. It is still a matter of debate whether viral integration contributes to the transformation process beyond ensuring the constitutive expression of the viral oncogenes. There is mounting evidence for a non-random distribution of integration loci and the direct involvement of cellular cancer-related genes. In this study we addressed this topic by extending the existing data set by an additional 47 HPV16 and HPV18 positive cervical carcinoma. We provide supportive evidence for previously defined integration hotspots and have revealed another cluster of integration sites within the cytogenetic band 3q28. Moreover, in the vicinity of these hotspots numerous microRNAs (miRNAs) are located and may be influenced by the integrated HPV DNA. By compiling our data and published reports 9 genes could be identified which were affected by HPV integration at least twice in independent tumors. In some tumors the viral-cellular fusion transcripts were even identical with respect to the viral donor and cellular acceptor sites used. However, the exact integration sites are likely to differ since none of the integration sites analysed thus far have shown more than a few nucleotides of homology between viral and host sequences. Therefore, DNA recombination involving large stretches of homology at the integration site can be ruled out. It is however intriguing that by sequence alignment several regions of the HPV16 genome were found to have highly homologous stretches of up to 50 nucleotides to the aforementioned genes and the integration hotspots. One common region of homologies with cellular sequences is between the viral gene E5 and L2 (nucleotides positions 4100 to 4240). We speculate that this and other regions of homology are involved in the integration process. Our observations suggest that targeted disruption, possibly also of critical cellular genes, by HPV integration remains an issue to be fully resolved.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Protein homology detection and sequence alignment are at the basis of protein structure prediction, function prediction and evolution. RESULTS: We have generalized the alignment of protein sequences with a profile hidden Markov model (HMM) to the case of pairwise alignment of profile HMMs. We present a method for detecting distant homologous relationships between proteins based on this approach. The method (HHsearch) is benchmarked together with BLAST, PSI-BLAST, HMMER and the profile-profile comparison tools PROF{\_}SIM and COMPASS, in an all-against-all comparison of a database of 3691 protein domains from SCOP 1.63 with pairwise sequence identities below 20{\%}.Sensitivity: When the predicted secondary structure is included in the HMMs, HHsearch is able to detect between 2.7 and 4.2 times more homologs than PSI-BLAST or HMMER and between 1.44 and 1.9 times more than COMPASS or PROF{\_}SIM for a rate of false positives of 10{\%}. Approximately half of the improvement over the profile-profile comparison methods is attributable to the use of profile HMMs in place of simple profiles. Alignment quality: Higher sensitivity is mirrored by an increased alignment quality. HHsearch produced 1.2, 1.7 and 3.3 times more good alignments ('balanced' score {\textgreater}0.3) than the next best method (COMPASS), and 1.6, 2.9 and 9.4 times more than PSI-BLAST, at the family, superfamily and fold level, respectively.Speed: HHsearch scans a query of 200 residues against 3691 domains in 33 s on an AMD64 2GHz PC.

@article{Turner2017,
abstract = {We have shown previously that the AKT2 pathway is essential for cell survival and important in malignant transformation. In this study, we demonstrate elevated kinase levels of AKT2 and phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K) in 32 of 80 primary breast carcinomas. The majority of the cases with the activation are estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) positive, which prompted us to examine whether AKT2 regulates ERalpha activity. We found that constitutively activated AKT2 or AKT2 activated by epidermal growth factor or insulin-like growth factor-1 promotes the transcriptional activity of ERalpha. This effect occurred in the absence or presence of estrogen. Activated AKT2 phosphorylates ERalpha in vitro and in vivo, but it does not phosphorylate a mutant ERalpha in which ser-167 was replaced by Ala. The PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin, abolishes both the phosphorylation and transcriptional activity of ERalpha induced by AKT2. However, AKT2-induced ERalpha activity was not inhibited by tamoxifen but was completely abolished by ICI 164,384, implicating that AKT2-activated ERalpha contributes to tamoxifen resistance. Moreover, we found that ERalpha binds to the p85alpha regulatory subunit of PI3K in the absence or presence of estradiol in epithelial cells and subsequently activates PI3K/AKT2, suggesting ERalpha regulation of PI3K/AKT2 through a nontranscriptional and ligand-independent mechanism. These data indicate that regulation between the ERalpha and PI3K/AKT2 pathway (ERalpha-PI3K/AKT2-ERalpha) may play an important role in pathogenesis of human breast cancer and could contribute to ligand-independent breast cancer cell growth.},

abstract = {Fueled by widespread applications of high-throughput next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies and urgent need to counter threats of pathogenic viruses, large-scale studies were conducted recently to investigate virus integration in host genomes (for example, human tumor genomes) that may cause carcinogenesis or other diseases. A limiting factor in these studies, however, is rapid virus evolution and resulting polymorphisms, which prevent reads from aligning readily to commonly used virus reference genomes, and, accordingly, make virus integration sites difficult to detect. Another confounding factor is host genomic instability as a result of virus insertions. To tackle these challenges and improve our capability to identify cryptic virus-host fusions, we present a new approach that detects Virus intEgration sites through iterative Reference SEquence customization (VERSE). To the best of our knowledge, VERSE is the first approach to improve detection through customizing reference genomes. Using 19 human tumors and cancer cell lines as test data, we demonstrated that VERSE substantially enhanced the sensitivity of virus integration site detection.

In 12{\%} of cancers, seven different viruses have been causally linked to human oncogenesis: Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis B virus, human papillomavirus, human T-cell lymphotropic virus, hepatitis C virus, Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus, and Merkel cell polyomavirus. Here, we review the many molecular mechanisms of oncogenesis that have been discovered over the decades of study of these viruses. We discuss how viruses can act at different stages in the complex multistep process of carcinogenesis. Early events include their involvement in mutagenic events associated with tumor initiation such as viral integration and insertional mutagenesis as well as viral promotion of DNA damage. Also involved in tumor progression is the dysregulation of cellular processes by viral proteins, and we describe how this has been investigated by studies in cell culture and in experimental animals and by molecular cellular approaches. Also important are the molecular mechanisms whereby viruses interact with the immune system and the immune evasion strategies that have evolved.},

abstract = {Reconstructing the origin and evolution of land plants and their algal relatives is a fundamental problem in plant phylogenetics, and is essential for understanding how critical adaptations arose, including the embryo, vascular tissue, seeds, and flowers. Despite advances in molecular systematics, some hypotheses of relationships remain weakly resolved. Inferring deep phylogenies with bouts of rapid diversification can be problematic; however, genome-scale data should significantly increase the number of informative characters for analyses. Recent phylogenomic reconstructions focused on the major divergences of plants have resulted in promising but inconsistent results. One limitation is sparse taxon sampling, likely resulting from the difficulty and cost of data generation. To address this limitation, transcriptome data for 92 streptophyte taxa were generated and analyzed along with 11 published plant genome sequences. Phylogenetic reconstructions were conducted using up to 852 nuclear genes and 1,701,170 aligned sites. Sixty-nine analyses were performed to test the robustness of phylogenetic inferences to permutations of the data matrix or to phylogenetic method, including supermatrix, supertree, and coalescent-based approaches, maximum-likelihood and Bayesian methods, partitioned and unpartitioned analyses, and amino acid versus DNA alignments. Among other results, we find robust support for a sister-group relationship between land plants and one group of streptophyte green algae, the Zygnematophyceae. Strong and robust support for a clade comprising liverworts and mosses is inconsistent with a widely accepted view of early land plant evolution, and suggests that phylogenetic hypotheses used to understand the evolution of fundamental plant traits should be reevaluated.},

abstract = {HPV-DNA integration into cellular chromatin is usually a necessary event in the pathogenesis of HPV-related cancer; however, the mechanism of integration has not been clearly defined. Breaks must be created in both the host DNA and in the circular viral episome for integration to occur, and studies have shown that viral integration is indeed increased by the induction of DNA double strand breaks. Inflammation generates reactive oxygen species, which in turn have the potential to create such DNA strand breaks. It is plausible that these breaks enable a greater frequency of HPV-DNA integration, and in this way contribute to carcinogenesis. Consistent with this idea, co-infections with certain sexually transmitted diseases cause cervical inflammation, and have also been identified as cofactors in the progression to cervical cancer. This article examines the idea that inflammation facilitates HPV-DNA integration into cellular chromatin through the generation of reactive oxygen species, thereby contributing to carcinogenesis.},

abstract = {Long interspersed nuclear element-1 (L1) retrotransposons are jumping genes that  comprise 17{\%} of human DNA. They utilize a ''copy-and-paste'' mechanism to propagate themselves throughout the genome via RNA intermediates, a process termed retrotransposition. L1s are active in the germ line and during embryogenesis, yet they are epigenetically suppressed in somatic cells. In cancer cells, however, L1s are aberrantly activated and may have a role in genome instability, one of the hallmarks of cancer pathogenesis. Their methylation states and retrotransposition activities are associated with and fluctuate during cancer initiation and progression, thus representing promising diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. During tumorigenesis, L1s exert both retrotransposition-dependent and retrotransposition-independent functions. The former may result in alterations in target gene expression or chromosomal rearrangement, or drive Alu and SVA, events that could function in tumorigenesis, whereas the latter can potentially exert epigenetic regulation by generating endo-siRNAs, forming chimeric L1 transcripts or changing the expression of adjacent genes by providing novel splicing sites or alternative promoters. Moreover, the L1 encoded proteins, ORF1p and ORF2p, may have pro-oncogenic potential by, for example, activating oncogenic transcriptional factors or sequestering oncosuppressors. Herein, we introduce the components and mechanisms of L1 retrotransposition, discuss the landscape, possible functions, and regulation of L1 activity in cancer, and seek their potential as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.Genet Med 18 5, 431-439.},

abstract = {Human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) and solitary long terminal repeats (LTRs) constitute 8{\%} of the human genome. Although most HERV genes are partially deleted and not intact, HERV LTRs comprise features including promoters, enhancers, selective splicer sites and polyadenylation sites in order to regulate the expression of neighboring genes. Owing to the genetic instability of LTRs, their wide distributions along human chromosomes are not only non-random, but are also correlated with gene density. Considerable evidence indicates that HERV LTRs regulate the expression of their adjacent viral and cellular genes in placental development and tumorigenesis. However, the regulatory mechanism of HERV LTRs on the expression of its neighboring cancer-associated genes in human cancers remains to be elucidated. Insertional mutagenesis, recombination and polymorphism are three principal factors of LTR that contribute to its genetic instability. Moreover, genetic instability, hypomethylation, transactivation and the antisense transcript of LTRs enhance the activity of LTRs and regulate the expression of their adjacent genes in human cancers. Therefore, in the present review, we examined the mechanism of HERV LTRs in tumorigenesis in combination with the structure and function of LTRs.},

abstract = {Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) plays critical roles in the development of hepatocellular carcinogenesis (HCC). Yes-associated protein (YAP), a downstream effector of the Hippo signaling pathway, is an important human oncogene. In the present study, we report that YAP is involved in the hepatocarcinogenesis mediated by HBx. We demonstrated that the expression of YAP was dramatically elevated in clinical HCC samples, hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected hepatoma HepG2.2.15 cell line, and liver cancer tissues of HBx-transgenic mice. Meanwhile, we found that the overexpression of HBx resulted in the up-regulation of YAP in stably HBx-transfected HepG2/H7402 hepatoma cell lines. Whereas, HBx RNAi reduced YAP expression in a dose-dependent manner in the above cell lines, suggesting that HBx up-regulates YAP. Then, we investigated the mechanism underlying the up-regulation of YAP by HBx. Luciferase reporter gene assays revealed that the promoter region of YAP regulated by HBx was located at nt -232/+115 containing cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) element. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) demonstrated that HBx was able to bind to the promoter of YAP, while it failed to work when CREB was silenced. Moreover, we confirmed that HBx activated the YAP promoter through CREB by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and luciferase reporter gene assays. Surprisingly, we found that YAP siRNA was able to remarkably block the HBx-enhanced growth of hepatoma cells in vivo and in vitro. CONCLUSION: YAP is a key driver gene in the HBx-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in a CREB-dependent manner. YAP may serve as a novel target in HBV-associated HCC therapy. (HEPATOLOGY 2012.).},

abstract = {PURPOSE: There is substantial heterogeneity within human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated head and neck cancer (HNC) tumors that predispose them to different outcomes; however, the molecular heterogeneity in this subgroup is poorly characterized due to various historical reasons. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We performed unsupervised gene expression clustering on deeply annotated (transcriptome and genome) HPV(+) HNC samples from two cohorts (84 total primary tumors), including 18 HPV(-) HNC samples, to discover subtypes and characterize the differences between subgroups in terms of their HPV characteristics, pathway activity, whole-genome somatic copy number alterations, and mutation frequencies. RESULTS: We identified two distinct HPV(+) subtypes (namely HPV-KRT and HPV-IMU). HPV-KRT is characterized by elevated expression of genes in keratinocyte differentiation and oxidation-reduction process, whereas HPV-IMU has strong immune response and mesenchymal differentiation. The differences in expression are likely connected to the differences in HPV characteristics and genomic changes. HPV-KRT has more genic viral integration, lower E2/E4/E5 expression levels, and higher ratio of spliced to full-length HPV oncogene E6 than HPV-IMU; the subgroups also show differences in copy number alterations and mutations, in particular the loss of chr16q in HPV-IMU and gain of chr3q and PIK3CA mutation in HPV-KRT. CONCLUSIONS: Our characterization of two subtypes of HPV(+) HNC tumors provides valuable molecular level information that point to two main carcinogenic paths.

abstract = {Persistent infections with high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) induce dysplastic lesions of the lower genital tract. Some of these lesions eventually progress to invasive cancers, particularly of the uterine cervix. In many advanced preneoplastic cervical lesions and most derived carcinomas, HPV genomes are found to be integrated into the host cell chromosomes. Although HPV integration seems to play an important role in the progression of cervical dysplasia, the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. To investigate the pathogenic role of genomic integration of HPV genomes in greater detail, we analysed integration sites of HPV16 and 18 genomes in 21 anogenital precancerous and cancerous lesions using a ligation-mediated chain reaction (DIPS) and the recently described amplification of papilloma virus oncogene transcripts (APOT) assay. On the genomic level, only singular integration events were observed in individual neoplastic cell clones. At many integration sites, a short overlap between HPV and genomic sequences was observed, suggesting that the integration of HPV genomes is mediated by nonhomologous sequence-specific recombination. APOT analysis revealed that the majority of integrated HPV genomes was actively transcribed. These data suggest that in the progression of cervical preneoplasia to invasive carcinomas, integration of viral genomes occurs only at single or few chromosomal loci in a given cell clone. Disruption of cellular genes might support malignant transformation in rare cases; however, it is not a pathogenic prerequisite. The main function of HPV integration seems to be the stabilization of oncogene transcription.},

This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},
